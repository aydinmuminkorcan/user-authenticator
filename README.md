# User Authentication

This project illustrates all scenarios of Sign In / Sign Up process for a web application with fully responsive UI. It can be used as a subsystem or template for the projects which need user authentication and/or authorization.

### Prerequisites

* _NodeJS and related command line tools_: You need to install the latest version  of NodeJS runtime before you do anything. It can be installed in various ways, but we recommend to install it via nvm (Node Version Manager) a bash script used to manage multiple released Node.js versions. To install nvm, apply the instructions on https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script. Then, type to check
  
    ```
    nvm --version
    ```
    You may list the versions available for installation
    ```
    nvm ls-remote
    ```
    and install one or more of them by 

    ```
    nvm install <version-of-nodejs>
    ```
    Then check if it worked 

    ```
    node --version
    npm  --version
    ```
    Finally, you can pick one of the installed versions by
    ```
    nvm use <version-of-nodejs>
    ```
* _Mongodb_: Install mongodb by the help of [this guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) or simply 
  download and add its bin directory to path variable
